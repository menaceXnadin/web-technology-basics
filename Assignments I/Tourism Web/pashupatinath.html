      <h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
      <p>
        Pashupatinath Temple is one of the holiest Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. Located on the banks of the Bagmati River in Kathmandu, Nepal, this sacred site has deep religious and cultural significance. The temple's origins date back to ancient times, and its current architecture reflects a blend of traditional Nepalese pagoda style.

      <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
      <p>
        Pashupatinath stands as a sprawling complex of temples, ashrams, and cremation ghats. The main temple, dedicated to Lord Pashupatinath, is a two-tiered pagoda adorned with silver doors and roofs made of gold. The temple complex bustles with pilgrims and Sadhus (holy men), and the atmosphere resonates with spiritual fervor. Along the riverbanks, the cremation ghats present a solemn yet culturally significant sight, where Hindu rituals for the deceased are performed. The surroundings echo with prayers, rituals, and the scent of incense, creating a deeply spiritual ambiance.
