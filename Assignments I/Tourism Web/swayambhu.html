      <h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
      <p>
        Swayambhunath, also known as the Monkey Temple, is one of the oldest and
        most sacred Buddhist sites in Nepal. It is located on a hill overlooking
        the Kathmandu Valley, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to
        legend, the valley was once covered by a large lake, and a lotus flower
        grew in the middle of the lake. The flower bloomed into a magnificent
        stupa, and the valley was named Swayambhu, meaning "Self-arisen." The
        exact date of the construction of the stupa is unknown, but it is
        believed to be over 2,000 years old. The first recorded mention of
        Swayambhunath is in an inscription dating from the 6th century CE. The
        stupa has been rebuilt and renovated several times over the centuries.
        The most recent major renovation was completed in 2006.

      <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
      <p>
        Swayambhunath, also known as the Monkey Temple, is a sacred and ancient
        religious complex situated atop a hill in Kathmandu, Nepal. Its name,
        "Swayambhu," means "self-existent one," reflecting the belief that the
        stupa emerged on its own. At its heart is a stupa—a dome-shaped
        structure—adorned with the watchful eyes of Buddha, symbolizing wisdom
        and compassion. The base of the stupa is surrounded by prayer wheels and
        colorful prayer flags fluttering in the breeze, carrying prayers and
        mantras. Ascending the stairs to reach the stupa, visitors encounter
        various shrines, temples, and statues, each contributing to the
        spiritual and cultural richness of the site. The site's serene
        atmosphere is complemented by the scent of incense, the sound of chants,
        and the playful presence of monkeys that roam freely around the complex.
