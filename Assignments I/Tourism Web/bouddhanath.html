      <h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
      <p>
        Boudhanath, also known as Boudha, is one of the largest and most important
        Buddhist stupas in Nepal. It is situated in the eastern outskirts of
        Kathmandu and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The stupa's construction
        dates back to the 5th century, and it is believed to enshrine the remains
        of Kassapa Buddha, making it a significant pilgrimage site for followers
        of Buddhism.
      </p>
      <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
      <p>
        Boudhanath is characterized by its massive mandala, a representation of
        the Buddhist universe, adorned with colorful prayer flags and prayer
        wheels. The stupa's white dome is topped with a gilded spire and
        encompassed by a circular market bustling with shops, monasteries, and
        cafes. Pilgrims and visitors can be seen circumambulating the stupa,
        spinning prayer wheels and chanting mantras as part of their devotional
        practices. The area exudes a tranquil ambiance, amplified by the
        mesmerizing sight of monks, prayer flags fluttering in the breeze, and
        the scent of incense permeating the air.
